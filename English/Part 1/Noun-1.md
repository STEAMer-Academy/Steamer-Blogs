# What is a noun? A Cornerstone of Language  
## Nouns: The Building Blocks of Sentences  

We all know, Noun is a naming word.  
Nouns are the fundamental words in any language, serving as the names for people, places, things, and ideas. 
They are the essential components that form the backbone of sentences. Without nouns, our communication would be limited and unclear.

## What Do Nouns Do?  
**Identify:** 
Nouns pinpoint specific individuals, objects, or concepts.
Example: *John, New York City, book, happiness*  
**Act as Subjects:**   
Nouns often occupy the subject position in a sentence.
Example: *The cat purrs.*  
**Serve as Objects:**  
Nouns can also function as the object of a verb or preposition.
Example: *I love chocolate.*  
**Form Phrases:**  
Nouns combine with other words to create noun phrases.
Example: *The big, red apple*

## Types of Nouns  
Nouns can be categorized into several types based on their characteristics:
1. **Proper Nouns:** 
Specific names for people, places, or things.
Example: *John Smith, Paris, Google,  Linux*

2. **Common Nouns:** 
General names for people, places, things, or ideas.
Example: *boy, city, car*

Note: Proper Noun always starts with capital letter but it is not same in case of Common Noun.


3. **Collective Nouns:**
Nouns that refer to a group of people, animals, or things.
Example: *team, family, herd*

Note:
There's distinction between a Collective Noun and a Noun of Multitude  
(a) A Collective Noun one undivided whole and hence the verb following is singular.  
(b) A Noun of Multitude denotes the individuals of the group and hence the verb is plural, although the noun is singular.


4. **Material Noun:**
Noun that denotes the matter or substance on which things are made.
Example: *gold, wood, water, coal*


Note:
In general purposes, article doesn't sit before Material Noun. But if the Material Noun is used in a specified meaning, there sits a The before it.
Example:
Coal is black. 
But, the coal of Jharia is of good quality.

5. **Abstract Nouns:** 
Nouns that represent ideas, qualities, or concepts that cannot be physically perceived.
Example: *happiness, love, beauty*  

Note:  According to Nesfield, Abstract noun relates to qualities states, or action which can not be seen or touched. But this thing is not always true, because 'movement' or 'laughter' are works which can't be touched but can be seen.
