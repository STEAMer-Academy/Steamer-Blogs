# Part 1:GEOMETRY

DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS GEOMETRY\
You've heard the name even if you don't remember its definition.

**Geometry**, the branch of mathematics concerned with the shape of individual objects, [spatial](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/spatial) relationships among various objects, and the properties of surrounding space. It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, having arisen in response to such practical problems as those found in surveying, and its name is derived from GREEK words meaning “Earth measurement.”

**Geometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and the properties of space. It is used in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and art.**

**However, there are some fun and interesting facts about geometry that you might not know. Let’s explore some of these fun facts about geometry.**

- The concept of zero was first introduced in geometry. It was used to represent a point, line, or plane that has no dimension.

- The Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, is named after the Greek mathematician Pythagoras.

- The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, which is known as the Euclidean distance. It is named after the Greek mathematician Euclid.

- A triangle with sides of equal length is called an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle with angles measuring 60 degrees each is called a regular triangle.

- A circle is a shape with infinite lines of symmetry. This means that if you draw a line through the center of the circle, it will be split into two identical halves.

- The Golden Ratio, also known as the Divine Proportion, is a mathematical ratio that appears in many geometric shapes, such as the spiral found in the Nautilus shell and the shape of a pineapple. It is often considered to be aesthetically pleasing and is used in art and architecture.

- The concept of pi (π), which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, was first introduced by the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians. However, it was the Greek mathematician Archimedes who calculated the value of pi to be between 3.1408 and 3.1429.

# History

**Classic geometry was focused in [compass and straightedge constructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction). Geometry was revolutionised by [Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid), who introduced [mathematical rigor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_rigor) and the [axiomatic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_method) still in use today. His book, [_The Elements_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_Elements) is widely considered the most influential textbook of all time, and was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century.**

# EGYPTIAN GEOMETRY

The ancient Egyptians knew that they could approximate the area of a circle as follows:[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_geometry#cite_note-School_Mathematics-2)

**_Area of Circle ≈ \[ (Diameter) x 8/9 \]2_**

Problem 50 of the [Ahmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmes) papyrus uses these methods to calculate the area of a circle, according to a rule that the area is equal to the square of 8/9 of the circle's diameter. This assumes that [_π_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) is 4×(8/9)2 (or 3.160493...), with an error of slightly over 0.63 percent. This value was slightly less accurate than the calculations of the [Babylonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia) (25/8 = 3.125, within 0.53 percent), but was not otherwise surpassed until [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes)' approximation of 211875/67441 = 3.14163, which had an error of just over 1 in 10,000.

**Thales and Pythagoras**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEAMer-Academy/Steamer-Blogs/refs/heads/main/Math/Geometry/Part%201/Images/image%205.svg" width="30%" /> [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem): a² + b² = c²

[Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales) of [Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus) , was the first to whom deduction in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote deductive proofs, though his proofs have not survived. [Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) (582–496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and travelled to [Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon) and [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt). The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he was probably one of the first to give a deductive proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of [incommensurable](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensurability_(mathematics)>).
