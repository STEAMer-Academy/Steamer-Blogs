God told me to do some good things but I did many sin theta!🤓\
**Why did a priest refuse to learn trigonometry?**\
Because it is full of sin\*\*. 😆\*\*\
**Let’s Talk ABout WHat is TriGonometry**\
**Trigonometry 'triangle' and 'measure'is a branch of mathematics concerned with relationships between angles and side lengths of triangles.**\

**There are six functions of an angle commonly used in trigonometry. Their names and abbreviations are [sine](https://www.britannica.com/science/sine) (sin), [cosine](https://www.britannica.com/science/cosine) (cos), [tangent](https://www.britannica.com/science/tangent-mathematical-function) (tan), [cotangent](https://www.britannica.com/science/cotangent) (cot), [secant](https://www.britannica.com/science/secant) (sec), and [cosecant](https://www.britannica.com/science/cosecant) (csc). These six trigonometric functions in relation to a right [triangle](https://www.britannica.com/science/triangle-mathematics) are displayed in the figure. For example, the triangle contains an angle _A_, and the [ratio](https://www.britannica.com/science/ratio) of the side opposite to _A_ and the side opposite to the right angle (the hypotenuse) is called the sine of _A_, or sin _A_; the other trigonometry functions are defined similarly. These functions are properties of the angle _A_ independent of the size of the triangle, and calculated [values](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/values) were tabulated for many angles before [computers](https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer) made [trigonometry tables](https://www.britannica.com/science/trigonometry-table) obsolete. [Trigonometric functions](https://www.britannica.com/science/trigonometry/Principles-of-trigonometry#ref12232) are used in obtaining unknown angles and distances from known or measured angles in geometric figures.Sine is the ratio of the opposite side over the hypotenuse, cosine is the ratio of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse, and tangent is the ratio of the opposite side over the adjacent side. The opposite side is the side across from the angle and the adjacent side is the side that forms the angle.**\
\*\*Let us see the table where the values of sin cos tan sec cosec and tan are provided for the important angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEAMer-Academy/Steamer-Blogs/refs/heads/main/Math/Geometry/Part%202/Images/Image%202.png" />
\*\*●To remember the trigonometric values given in the above table, follow the below steps:\*\*

- **First divide the numbers 0,1,2,3, and 4 by 4 and then take the positive roots of all those numbers.**
- **Hence, we get the values for sine ratios,i.e., 0, ½, 1/√2, √3/2, and 1 for angles 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°**
- **Now, write the values of sine degrees in reverse order to get the values of cosine for the same angles.**
- **As we know, tan is the ratio of sin and cos, such as tan θ = sin θ/cos θ. Thus, we can get the values of tan ratio for the specific angles.**

**🔸Sin Values**\
**sin 0° = √(0/4) = 0**

**sin 30° = √(1/4) = ½**

**sin 45° = √(2/4) = 1/√2**

**sin 60° = √3/4 = √3/2**

**sin 90° = √(4/4) = 1**

**🔸Cos Values**\
**cos 0° = √(4/4) = 1**

**cos 30° = √(3/4) = √3/2**

**cos 45° = √(2/4) = 1/√2**

**cos 60° = √(1/4) = 1/2**

**cos 90° = √(0/4) = 0**

**🔸Tan Values**

**tan 0° = 0/1 = 0**

**tan 30° = (1/2) / (√3/2) = 1/√3**

**tan 45° = (1/√2) / (1/√2) = 1**

**tan 60° = \[(√3/2)/(½)\] = √3**

**tan 90° = 1/0 = ∞**

## Solved Examples

**Example 1:**

**Find the value of (sin 30° + cos 30°) – (sin 60° + cos 60°).**

**Solution:**

**We know that,**

**sin 30° = 1/2**

**cos 30° = √3/2**

**sin 60° = √3/2**

**cos 60° = 1/2**

**Now,**

**(sin 30° + cos 30°) – (sin 60° + cos 60°)**

**= \[(1/2) + (√3/2)\] – \[(√3/2) + (1/2)\]**

**= (1/2) + (√3/2) – (√3/2) – (1/2)**

**= 0**

**Example 2:**

**If A = 30°, prove that tan 2A = 2 tan A/(1 – tan2A).**

**Solution:**

**Given,**

**A = 30°**

**tan 2A = tan 2(30°) = tan 60°**

**As we know, tan 60° = √3.**

**So, tan 2A = √3**

**Now,**

**2 tan A/(1 – tan2A)**

**= \[2 tan 30°/(1 – tan2(30°)\]**

**= \[2(1/√3)\]/ \[1 – (1/√3)2\]**

**= (2/√3)/ \[(3 – 1)/3\]**

**= 3/√3**

**= √3**

**Therefore, tan 2A = 2 tan A/(1 – tan2A)**

**Hence proved.**

**Here is some example to understand this topic**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEAMer-Academy/Steamer-Blogs/refs/heads/main/Math/Geometry/Part%202/Images/Image%203.png" />

**Solution:**

**From the given,**

**PQ = 12 cm**

**PR = 13 cm**

**In the right triangle PQR, Q is right angle.**

**By Pythagoras theorem,**

**PR2 = PQ2 + QR2**

**QR2 = (13)2 – (12)2**

**= 169 – 144**

**= 25**

**QR = 5 cm**

**tan P = QR/PQ = 5/12**

**cot R = QR/PQ = 5/12**

**So, tan P – cot R = (5/12) – (5/12) = 0**
