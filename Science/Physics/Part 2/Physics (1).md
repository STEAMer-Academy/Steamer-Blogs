Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.\
[_(Read Einstein’s 1926 Britannica essay on space-time.)_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Albert-Einstein-on-Space-Time-1987141)\
Physics is the basic [physical science](https://www.britannica.com/science/physical-science). Until rather recent times _physics_ and _natural philosophy_ were used interchangeably for the science whose aim is the discovery and formulation of the fundamental laws of nature. As the modern sciences developed and became increasingly specialized, physics came to denote that part of physical science not included in [astronomy](https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy), [chemistry](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemistry), [geology](https://www.britannica.com/science/geology), and [engineering](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering). Physics plays an important role in all the natural sciences, however, and all such fields have branches in which physical laws and measurements receive special emphasis, bearing such names as [astrophysics](https://www.britannica.com/science/astrophysics), [geophysics](https://www.britannica.com/science/geophysics), [biophysics](https://www.britannica.com/science/biophysics), and even [psychophysics](https://www.britannica.com/science/psychophysics). Physics can, at base, be defined as the science of [matter](https://www.britannica.com/science/matter), [motion](https://www.britannica.com/science/motion-mechanics), and [energy](https://www.britannica.com/science/energy). Its laws are typically expressed with economy and precision in the language of [mathematics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mathematics)

Mechanics is generally taken to mean the study of the motion of objects (or their lack of motion) under the action of given forces. Classical mechanics is sometimes considered a branch of applied mathematics. It consists of [kinematics](https://www.britannica.com/science/kinematics), the description of motion, and [dynamics](https://www.britannica.com/science/dynamics-physics), the study of the action of forces in producing either motion or [static equilibrium](https://www.britannica.com/science/equilibrium-physics) (the latter [constituting](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituting) the science of [statics](https://www.britannica.com/science/statics)). The 20th-century subjects of [quantum](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quantum) mechanics, crucial to treating the structure of matter, [subatomic particles](https://www.britannica.com/science/subatomic-particle), [superfluidity](https://www.britannica.com/science/superfluidity), [superconductivity](https://www.britannica.com/science/superconductivity), [neutron stars](https://www.britannica.com/science/neutron-star), and other major phenomena, and [relativistic mechanics](https://www.britannica.com/science/relativistic-mechanics), important when speeds approach that of light, are forms of mechanics that will be discussed later in this section.In classical mechanics the laws are initially formulated for point particles in which the dimensions, shapes, and other [intrinsic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intrinsic) properties of bodies are ignored. Thus in the first approximation even objects as large as [Earth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth) and the [Sun](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sun) are treated as pointlike—e.g., in calculating planetary orbital motion. In rigid-body [dynamics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dynamics), the extension of bodies and their mass distributions are considered as well, but they are imagined to be incapable of [deformation](https://www.britannica.com/science/deformation-mechanics). The mechanics of deformable solids is [elasticity](https://www.britannica.com/science/elasticity-physics); [hydrostatics](https://www.britannica.com/science/hydrostatics) and [hydrodynamics](https://www.britannica.com/science/fluid-mechanics/Hydrodynamics#ref77483) treat, respectively, fluids at rest and in motion.\
The three [laws of motion](https://www.britannica.com/science/Newtons-laws-of-motion) set forth by [Isaac Newton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-Newton) form the foundation of classical mechanics, together with the recognition that forces are directed quantities ([vectors](https://www.britannica.com/science/vector-physics)) and combine accordingly. The first law, also called the [law of inertia](https://www.britannica.com/science/inertia), states that, unless acted upon by an external [force](https://www.britannica.com/science/force-physics), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEAMer-Academy/Steamer-Blogs/refs/heads/main/Science/Physics/Part%202/Images/Image%203.png" /> an object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, it continues to move in a straight line with constant [speed](https://www.britannica.com/technology/speed-photography). Uniform motion therefore does not require a cause. Accordingly, mechanics concentrates not on motion as such but on the change in the state of motion of an object that results from the net [force](https://www.britannica.com/science/law-of-force) acting upon it. Newton’s second law equates the net force on an object to the rate of change of its momentum, the latter being the product of the mass of a body and its velocity. Newton’s third law, that of action and reaction, states that when two particles interact, the forces each [exerts](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/exerts) on the other are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Taken together, these mechanical laws in principle permit the determination of the future motions of a set of particles, providing their state of motion is known at some instant, as well as the forces that act between them and upon them from the outside. From this deterministic character of the laws of classical mechanics, profound (and probably incorrect) philosophical conclusions have been drawn in the past and even applied to human history.\
Lying at the most basic level of physics, the laws of mechanics are characterized by certain [symmetry](https://www.britannica.com/science/symmetry-physics) properties, as [exemplified](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/exemplified) in the aforementioned symmetry between action and reaction forces. Other symmetries, such as the invariance (i.e., unchanging form) of the laws under reflections and rotations carried out in [space](https://www.britannica.com/science/space-physics-and-metaphysics), reversal of time, or transformation to a different part of space or to a different epoch of time, are present both in classical mechanics and in relativistic mechanics, and with certain restrictions, also in quantum mechanics. The symmetry properties of the theory can be shown to have as mathematical consequences basic principles known as [conservation laws](https://www.britannica.com/science/conservation-law), which assert the constancy in time of the values of certain physical quantities under prescribed conditions. The conserved quantities are the most important ones in physics; included among them are mass and energy (in relativity theory, mass and energy are equivalent and are conserved together), [momentum](https://www.britannica.com/science/momentum), [angular momentum](https://www.britannica.com/science/angular-momentum), and [electric charge](https://www.britannica.com/science/electric-charge).\

of [inquiry](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/inquiry) has in the past been placed within classical [mechanics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mechanics) for historical reasons, because both fields were brought to a high state of perfection by Newton and also because of its universal character. Newton’s gravitational law states that every material particle in the [universe](https://www.britannica.com/science/universe) attracts every other one with a [force](https://www.britannica.com/science/force-physics) that acts along the line joining them and whose strength is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their separation. Newton’s detailed accounting for the orbits of the planets and the [Moon](https://www.britannica.com/place/Moon), as well as for such subtle gravitational effects as the [tides](https://www.britannica.com/science/tide) and the [precession of the equinoxes](https://www.britannica.com/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes) (a slow cyclical change in direction of [Earth’s](https://www.britannica.com/place/Earth) axis of rotation), through this [fundamental force](https://www.britannica.com/science/fundamental-interaction) was the first triumph of classical mechanics. No further principles are required to understand the principal aspects of [rocketry](https://www.britannica.com/technology/rocket-jet-propulsion-device-and-vehicle) and [space flight](https://www.britannica.com/science/space-exploration) (although, of course, a [formidable](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formidable) [technology](https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology) is needed to carry them out)\

The four dimensional space-time continuum itself is distorted in the vicinity of any mass, with the amount of distortion depending on the mass and the distance from the mass. Thus, relativity accounts for Newton's inverse square law of gravity through geometry and thereby does away with the need for any mysterious “action at a distance.”

## **What are Newton’s Laws of Motion?**

1. **An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.**
1. **The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.**
1. **Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.**

## **Newton’s First Law: Inertia**

#### **An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.**

Newton’s first law states that every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This tendency to resist changes in a state of motion is **inertia**. If all the external forces cancel each other out, then there is no net force acting on the object. If there is no net force acting on the object, then the object will maintain a constant velocity

## **Newton’s Second Law: Force**

#### **The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.**

LAW OF Conservation of ENERGY

The law of conservation of energy states that **_energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Although, it may be transformed from one form to another._** If you take all forms of energy into account, the total energy of an isolated system always remains constant. All the [forms of energy](https://byjus.com/physics/energy/) follow the law of conservation of energy. In brief, the law of conservation of energy states that

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEAMer-Academy/Steamer-Blogs/refs/heads/main/Science/Physics/Part%202/Images/Image%2015.png" />

Heat, current, solar, nuclear, and hydro-power are the various forms of energy. As per the law of energy conservation, “Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Although, it may be transformed from one form to another”. In a closed system, i.e. a system isolated from its surroundings, the system’s total energy is conserved.

The amount of energy in any system is determined by the following equation:

UT=Ui+W+Q

Where,

- UT – total energy of a system
- Ui – initial energy of a system
- Q – heat added or removed from the system
- W – work done by or on the system
