# Part 1:SCIENCE ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ـ♡ﮩ٨ـﮩﮩ٨ـ   
Just hearing the name creates a different feeling.The word “science” probably brings to mind many different pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats and microscopes, an astronomer peering through a telescope, a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein’s equations scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling beakers.The following articles are for you to get a better idea about it. First of all we know what SCIENCE is   

            So Let’s start …..  

Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. 🫀🧠IN school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static facts listed in a textbook, but that’s only a small part of the story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.  

Science is exciting 🧪🔬🧬👨🏻‍🔬Science is a way of discovering what’s in the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.  
Science is useful. 🤍☁️🌿🍃✨️ The knowledge generated by science is powerful and reliable. It can be used to develop new technologies, treat diseases, and deal with many other sorts of problems.  

Science is ongoing. 🩺SCIENCE is continually refining and expanding our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions for future investigation. Science will never be “finished.”  
Science is a global human endeavour.🌎People all over the world participate in the process of science. And you can too\!
                
## Today we talk about …….  
                                        
The word biology is derived from the Greek words bios meaning life  🫀 and logos meaning study 📓🗒 and is defined as the science of life and living organisms. An organism is a living entity consisting of one cell e.g. bacteria, or several cells e.g. animals, plants and fungi. Aspects of biological science range from the study of molecular mechanisms in cells, to the classification and behavior of organisms, how species evolve and interaction between ecosystems.Biology often overlaps with other sciences; for example, biochemistry and toxicology with biology, chemistry, and medicine; biophysics with biology and physics; stratigraphy with biology and geography; astrobiology with biology and astronomy. Social sciences such as geography, philosophy, psychology and sociology can also interact with biology, for example, in administration of biological resources, developmental biology, biogeography, evolutionary psychology and ethics.

Biology caters to these intriguing aspects through various sub-disciplines or branches. Some branches are intertwined with other disciplines of science.For instance, theoretical biology is a branch of biology that encompasses mathematical models to investigate certain principles that affect life.Quantum Biology deals with biological processes that are quantum mechanical in nature – such as the conversion of energy into more usable forms. Other branches of biology are as follows:

# History of BIOLOGY⚛

Before the term biology was adapted, other terms existed which described the study of plants and animals. For instance, the term Natural History was used to explain animals, plants, fungi and other lifeforms in their natural environment.Furthermore, it was observational rather than an experimental field of study. Hence, a person who would study natural history is termed as a natural historian or a naturalist. Other terms that came before biology included Natural Theology and Natural philosophy.The term “Biology”, in the modern sense, was introduced through the works of Michael Christoph Hanow in 1766. However, it was introduced independently four more times through the works of Thomas Beddoes (1799), Karl Friedrich Burdach (1800), Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (1802) and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1802).

# Origins as a Field of Study📚

For the very first humans, knowledge about plants and animals meant the difference between life or death. As a result, cumulative knowledge about species, behavior and anatomy were passed down for many generations.However, the most significant development in biological knowledge came when humans transitioned from hunters and foragers to farmers, cultivating crops and perfecting agriculture.Traditions of medicine, collective knowledge from physicians, works of prominent historical figures such as Aristotle eventually coalesced into the field of study we know today as biology.

The most significant revolutions in biology came during the 19th century, with a host of discoveries and technological innovations.

So what do you think now  ꒰ᐢ. .ᐢ꒱,,,, biology really has a lot of spread in hard history. I love studying biology  ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) and researching it.
