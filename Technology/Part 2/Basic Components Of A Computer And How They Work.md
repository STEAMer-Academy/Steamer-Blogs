# Part 2 : Basic components of a computer and how computers work

## What are components of a computer?

A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.

## Hardware VS Software

### Hardware

Hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound card, and motherboard. By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system.

### Software

Software is a collection of instructions and data that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to physical hardware, from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, including programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries, and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of your computer. It handles all the instructions you give your computer, and the faster it does this, the better. The CPU is made up of two parts: the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit. The control unit fetches instructions from memory and decodes them, while the arithmetic logic unit performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.  

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

Random access memory (RAM) is the temporary storage space your computer uses to store data that it needs to access quickly. It’s different from the computer’s hard drive, which is where you store files and data permanently. The more RAM your computer has, the more data it can store and access quickly. This can help speed up your computer.

### Hard Drive

The hard drive is where your computer stores all the data it needs to run. This includes the operating system, applications, and files. The hard drive is a non-volatile storage device, which means it retains data even when the computer is turned off. Hard drives are available in different sizes and speeds, so you can choose one that fits your needs.

### motherboard

The motherboard is the main circuit board in your computer. It connects all the other components together and allows them to communicate with each other. The motherboard also contains the CPU, RAM, and other essential components. When choosing a motherboard, make sure it’s compatible with your CPU and other hardware.

### Power Supply

The power supply is what provides electricity to your computer. It converts the electricity from your wall outlet into a form that your computer can use. The power supply is an essential component of your computer, so make sure you choose one that’s reliable and efficient.

### Graphics Card

The graphics card is what allows your computer to display images on your monitor. It’s especially important if you’re a gamer or work with graphics-intensive applications. The graphics card is connected to the motherboard and has its own memory and processing power.

### Peripherals

Peripherals are devices that connect to your computer, such as a keyboard, mouse, printer, or scanner. These devices allow you to interact with your computer and perform specific tasks. Peripherals can be connected to your computer using cables or wirelessly.

## How do computers work?

### Understanding Binary (Bits and Bytes)

Computers use a binary system to store and process data. This system uses two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all numbers and characters. Each digit is called a bit, and a group of eight bits is called a byte. For example, the letter A is represented by the binary number 01000001. There is a direct relationship between bits and bytes: 1 byte = 8 bits. Also, there is a chart that shows the relationship between bits and bytes. This are called ASCII table.

### Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer follows a series of steps to execute instructions. This process is called the fetch-decode-execute cycle. First, the CPU fetches an instruction from memory. Then, it decodes the instruction to determine what operation to perform. Finally, it executes the instruction and stores the result.

### Operating System

The operating system is the software that manages all the hardware and software on your computer. It controls how your computer boots up, runs applications, and communicates with peripherals. The operating system also provides a user interface that allows you to interact with your computer.

### Binary System

The binary system is a number system that uses only two digits, 0 and 1. This system is used by computers to store and process data. Each digit in a binary number is called a bit, and a group of eight bits is called a byte. For example, the binary number 01000001 represents the letter A.

## Basic Data Processing and Storage

### Input

Input is the data that you enter into your computer. This can be text, numbers, images, or any other type of information. Input devices include keyboards, mice, scanners, and microphones.

### Processing

Processing is the manipulation of data to produce a desired result. This can involve performing calculations, sorting data, or converting data from one form to another. The central processing unit (CPU) is responsible for processing data in a computer.

### Output

Output is the result of processing data. This can be text, images, sounds, or any other type of information. Output devices include monitors, printers, speakers, and headphones.

### Storage

Storage is the retention of data for future use. This can involve saving data to a hard drive, USB drive, or cloud storage service. Storage devices include hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives.

## Ram VS HDD VS SSD

### RAM

RAM (random access memory) is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used. It is a volatile memory, meaning that it loses its contents when the power is turned off. RAM is much faster than hard drives and is used to store data that the CPU needs to access quickly.

### HDD

HDD (hard disk drive) is a type of computer storage device that uses magnetic storage to store data. It is a non-volatile memory, meaning that it retains its contents when the power is turned off. HDDs are slower than RAM but have a much larger storage capacity.

### SSD

SSD (solid-state drive) is a type of computer storage device that uses flash memory to store data. It is a non-volatile memory, meaning that it retains its contents when the power is turned off. SSDs are faster than HDDs and have a larger storage capacity than RAM.

## Conclusion

Computers are complex machines that consist of many different components. Understanding how these components work together can help you make informed decisions when buying or using a computer. By learning about the basic components of a computer and how computers work, you can better understand how to use them effectively. In the next blog, we will learn python, so stay tuned!
