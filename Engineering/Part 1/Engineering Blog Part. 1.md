#### **Engineering Concepts📑:**

In your science textbooks, you’ll find topics that are closely related to engineering. Let’s take a look at some of them and see how they connect to the world of engineering and also learn some new and easy concepts along the way.

 **1\. Forces and Motion 🌌** 

**Theory:** Forces are pushes or pulls that can change the motion of objects. Motion is how objects move from one place to another. Forces and motion are described by Newton’s laws of motion.

**Formulas and Calculations:**

* **Newton’s Second Law of Motion:**    

  <img src="Images/image 8.png" width="60%">

  * **F** is the force applied (in Newtons, N)  
  * **m** is the mass of the object (in kilograms, kg)  
  * **a** is the acceleration (in meters per second squared, m/s²)

  Example: If you push a cart with a force of 10 N and the cart has a mass of 2 kg, the acceleration is 10N/ 2 kg \= 5 m/s2

* **Gravity Force:**  

  <img src="Images/image 9.png" width="40%">

  * **g** is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.8 m/s² on Earth)

  Example: A book with a mass of 1 kg has a gravitational force of 1 kg×9.8 m/s2 \= 9.8 N.

* **Friction Force:**  

  <img src="Images/image 10.png" width="50%">

  * **μ** is the coefficient of friction  
  * **N** is the normal force (the force perpendicular to the surface)

  Example: If the coefficient of friction is 0.5 and the normal force is 10 N, the frictional force is 0.5×10 N=5 N.

         **Distance Covered with Constant Motion:**   

<img src="Images/image 11.png" width="50%">

* **d** is the distance covered (in meters, m)  
* **v** is the velocity (in meters per second, m/s)  
* **t** is the time (in seconds, s)

       Example: If a car travels at 20 m/s for 10 seconds, the distance covered is

       20 m/s×10 s \= 200 m.

        **Distance Covered with Uniform Acceleration:** 

<img src="Images/image 12.png" width="50%">

* **v\_i** is the initial velocity (in m/s)  
* **a** is the acceleration (in m/s²)  
* **t** is the time (in seconds, s)

**Engineering Connection:** Engineers use these principles to design and test machines, vehicles, and structures to ensure they work safely and efficiently.

**2\. Simple Machines ⚙️🔧**

**Theory:** Simple machines make work easier by allowing us to apply less force to move objects. They include levers, pulleys, inclined planes, screws, wedges, and gears.

### **Understanding Mechanical Advantage: Making Work Easier**

**Mechanical Advantage (MA)** is a concept used to describe how simple machines make work easier. It measures the factor by which a machine multiplies the force applied to it, allowing you to lift or move a heavier load with less effort.

#### **What is Mechanical Advantage?**

Mechanical Advantage tells us how much a machine increases the force you apply. In simple terms, it’s a way of figuring out how effective a machine is at helping you move or lift things.

**Formulas and Calculations:**

* **Effort Arm and Load Arm:** In a lever, the effort arm is the distance from the fulcrum (pivot point) to where you apply force. The load arm is the distance from the fulcrum to the point where the load (object to be moved) is located.  
  1. **Effort Arm:** The part of the lever where you apply your force. The longer this arm, the less force you need to lift the load.  
  1. **Load Arm:** The part of the lever where the load is placed. The shorter this arm, the more force you need to lift the load.

* **Mechanical Advantage (MA) for Levers:**  
    
  <p>
    <img src="Images/image 14.png" width="50%">
    <img src="Images/image 15.png">
  </p>


  Example: If a seesaw has an effort arm of 2 meters and a load arm of 1 meter, the mechanical advantage is 2 m / 1 m \= 2\. This means you can lift a load with half the force by using this lever.


* **Mechanical Advantage for Pulleys:**    A pulley is a device that can increase the magnitude of an effort force. There are many types of pulleys and the mechanical advantages also vary for each of them.

### **Without Pulley**

<img src="Images/image 16.png">

With no pulley \- the effort force is *similar* to the load \- in opposite direction.

*S \= F                                  (1)* 

*where* 

*S \= effort force (N, lb)* 

*F \= load (N, lb)* 

So, the mechanical advantage will be 1

### **Single Pulley**

#### **Fixed Pulley**

<img src="Images/image 17.png">

With a single fixed pulley the effort force is *similar* (or more due to efficiency loss) to the load.

*S \= F                                (2)* 

The advantage with the single fixed pulley is that the direction of force is changed \- it is possible to pull down instead of lifting up.

So, the mechanical advantage will be 1

#### **Movable Pulley**

<img src="Images/image 18.png">

With a single moveable pulley the effort force is *half* (or more due to efficiency loss) of the load.

*S \= 1/2 F                                (3)* 

So the mechanical advantage will be 2

### **Combined Pulleys**

<img src="Images/image 19.png">

With a combined moveable pulley as above \- the effort force is *half* (or more due to efficiency loss) of the load.

*S \= 1/2 F                               (4)* 

Here, the mechanical advantage will be 2

To understand the concept of mechanical advantages in pulleys we can see this picture:

<img src="Images/image 20.png">

This demonstrates a few pulley setups. First, we’ll look at pulley system 1\. This is a simple pulley, and in order to keep a weight pulling with 100 N of force up in the air, you have to pull with 100 N. This is because all of the weight of the block creates a tension on that one single rope, and you have to pull with the same force. Since the ratio between weight force and the required force is 1:1, the mechanical advantage is 1\. Pretty easy.

Now in pulley system 2, we’ve added another pulley, one that moves with the weight. Notice how the 100 N force of the weight has been split in two by the presence of two ends of the rope to support the weight instead of just one. The system still balances out, 50+50–100=0, only now half of the tension is diverted to the ceiling, and you only have to pull with 50 N of force to lift 100 N. With a force ratio of 2:1 this time around, you have a mechanical advantage of 2\.

Again, with pulley system 3, we have divided up the force of the weight, but this time, by adding a third pulley and hooking the rope directly on the second pulley, it’s split into thirds. As you probably guessed, this gives us a mechanical advantage of 3\.

**So, Mechanical Advantage for Pulleys**  \=  The **number of loops of the rope**.

* **Efficiency:**    **Efficiency is denoted by η.** 

  <img src="Images/image 21.png" width="40%">

<Img src="Images/image 22.png">

**Engineering Connection:** Engineers use simple machines to create complex tools and systems. For instance, cranes use pulleys to lift heavy objects with less effort.

**3\. Energy 🔋**

**Theory:** Energy is the ability to do work. It comes in various forms such as kinetic (energy of motion), potential (stored energy), and thermal (heat energy). Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.

**Formulas and Calculations:**

* **Kinetic Energy (KE):**   

  <img src="Images/image 23.png">

  * **m** is mass (in kg)  
  * **v** is velocity (in m/s)

  <img src="Images/image 24.png">

* **Potential Energy (PE):** 

  <img src="Images/image 25.png">

  * **m** is mass (in kg)  
  * **g** is gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s²)  
  * **h** is height (in meters)

  Example: A book with a mass of 2 kg on a shelf 5 meters high has a potential energy of 2 kg × 9.8 m/s2 × 5 m= 98 J.

  **Energy Conservation:** The total energy in a closed system remains constant.

**Engineering Connection:** Engineers use these principles to design energy-efficient systems, such as power plants and renewable energy sources, ensuring optimal energy use and conservation.

**4\. Work and Power 💪 ⚡**

**Theory:** Work is done when a force moves an object over a distance. Power is the rate at which work is done.

**Formulas and Calculations:**

* **Work:** 

  <img src="Images/image 26.png">

  * **W** is the work (in J)  
  * **F** is the force (in N)  
  * **d** is the distance (in m)

  Example: If you push a box with a force of 10 N over a distance of 5 meters, the work done is 10 N × 5 m=50 J.

* **Power:**   

  <p>
    <img src="Images/image 27.jpg">
    <img src="Images/image 28.png">
  </p>

  * **P** is the power (in W)  
  * **W** is the work done (in J)  
  * **t** is the time (in s)

  Example: If you do 100 J of work in 10 seconds, the power is 100 J10 s \= 10 W

**Engineering Connection:** Engineers calculate work and power to design machinery, engines, and energy systems that perform tasks efficiently and effectively.
